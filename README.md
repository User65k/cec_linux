A pure rust library to use the [CEC linux API](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.9/media/uapi/cec/cec-api.html) (as found on Raspberry Pis with bookworm)

# Background

While libcec and thus [cec-rs](https://crates.io/crates/cec-rs) also works with the linux driver,
I noticed after upgrading from bullseye to bookworm that some messages are only visible to me in monitor mode.
So they are missing in cec-rs as well as the old firmware driver is gone in bookworm.
